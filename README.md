# tiny-url-api
A node application and RESTful API for `tiny urls`.

## Description
This RESTful API is meant to provide a simple baseline framework to get started with standard functionality needed like:

- Authentication
- Middleware for authenticated routes
  - Added an `auth token`
- ~~User registration and login~~

This application uses [node-app-api](https://github.com/rvansant2/node-app-api) but adds all the necessary inner workings needed to support the [tiny-url-app](https://github.com/rvansant2/tiny-url-ui) to create an API for `tiny URLs`.

## TODO
- Data Access Object (DAO) interface library
- Utils library
- Error Handler
